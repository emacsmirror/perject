* perject

This package allows the user to manage multiple projects in a single Emacs instance.

** The Name
The name is a play on "per project", since this package manages frames and buffers per project.
Moreover, "per" is a nod to the [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective]] package, which does a similar thing (a comparison follows below).

** Installation and Setup
Currently not on [[https://melpa.org/][melpa]].

With [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], the code looks as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package perject
  :ensure nil
  :load-path ;; your load path
  :config (perject-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

Since *perject* makes heavy use of the built-in *desktop* package, make sure to not change any settings
regarding desktop in your config file.

** Setup
TODO
